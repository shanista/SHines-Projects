#### Create a new contact
This method is under the public function of the contact class. Users are able to create a new contact by 
entering the contact's first name, last name, phone number, address and email address. 
This is done by using file handling, allowing the system to open the file and add the information
entered by the user to the file. This function also uses several methods inside of it along with a while loop
that allows the user to continously add new records to the file without returning to the main screen
unless the user select desires to exit once prompted.
